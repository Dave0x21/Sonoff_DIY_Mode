# Sonoff_DIY_Mode
Sonoff DIY API and tool rewritten from the original source of [itead](https://github.com/itead/Sonoff_Devices_DIY_Tools).

## Goals
I have rewritten the sonoff API and tools trying to make it easyer and much simple possible.

## Introduction
Sonoff DIY tools is used for Sonoff Basic [R3](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-basicr3-wifi-diy-smart-switch.html), [RFR3](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-rfr3.html) and [Mini](https://www.itead.cc/sonoff-mini.html) control via LAN, and not via eWeLink app with their servers, no package will come out of your network!
